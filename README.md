# BingoCardGenerator
Final Submission of Project


It's not where I want it to be, but I've spent this whole week trying to figure out HTML formatting to no avail.
Figuring out the webpage would damage the code and vice versa. Comments also need more clarity.
I'm going to continue to work on it this weekend after I get some rest, but I'm turning this in to show the progress I've made.
By next Tuesday, during the job fair, it should be looking good.
Thank you for your patience.
